    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This portfolio contains four reflections on my experience working in a team during the Entrepreneurship module. Our main activity was a presentation that included an interactive game in the “Working in Teams” class.</p>
    <p>These reflections cover team formation, communication, cultural awareness, emotional regulation, resilience, adaptability, and personal growth. Through these reflections, I aim to show how I became more self-aware, learned from my teammates, and developed teamwork skills that are essential in entrepreneurship.</p>

    <h2>Reflection 1: Team Formation and Roles</h2>
    <p>When our team was first formed, everyone was polite but a bit cautious. Since we did not know each other well, there was hesitation in sharing ideas, and most of us were unsure about how to contribute effectively. I remember feeling both excited and nervous; I wanted to contribute but was also careful not to dominate or make mistakes. During the first meeting, everyone introduced themselves and briefly shared ideas, but the conversation was tentative. Some teammates were reserved and thoughtful, while others were more outgoing and ready to lead. Observing these differences helped me understand how to communicate and collaborate with each individual.</p>
    <p>As we began planning the presentation and the interactive game, roles naturally emerged. One teammate organised meetings and managed deadlines, another focused on content and creative ideas, and others handled slides and logistical arrangements. I primarily took on coordination and content preparation. This allowed me to see how my contributions directly impacted the team’s progress. Recognising the strengths of each member helped us allocate tasks efficiently and improved overall productivity.</p>
    <p>During the early stages, minor disagreements arose regarding workload and timing. Some teammates wanted to complete tasks quickly, while others preferred a slower, more reflective approach. Initially, I felt frustrated because I valued efficiency, but I soon realised that respecting different working styles was essential. Through open discussion, we clarified responsibilities and set shared deadlines. This process helped us work more effectively and taught me the importance of communication and compromise in teamwork.</p>
    <p>Working in this team also made me reflect on my own cultural and personal preferences. I naturally value direct communication, structure, and organisation, but I noticed that some teammates preferred a more flexible and reflective approach. Initially, I expected everyone to work like me, but I learned to adjust my expectations, practise patience, and respond flexibly. Allowing space for different approaches led to better ideas and smoother collaboration.</p>
    <p>This experience taught me that understanding roles, recognising individual strengths, and reflecting on my own behaviour are crucial for effective teamwork. Taking initiative is important, but it must be balanced with listening and collaborating with others. Finally, being flexible and open to different approaches helps prevent conflicts and improves outcomes. Overall, this reflection highlighted the importance of adaptability, self-awareness, and proactive engagement in a team setting.</p>

    <h2>Reflection 2: Communication, Conflict, and Cultural Awareness</h2>
    <p>Communication was one of the biggest challenges in our team. Most discussions happened via WhatsApp or in short meetings after class. Sometimes messages were unclear or delayed, which created confusion, especially close to deadlines. For example, there was a moment when two teammates assumed the other was responsible for a section of the game, which led to last-minute stress. These situations made me realise the importance of confirming tasks and responsibilities clearly.</p>
    <p>Conflict often arose from different working styles. Some members preferred to complete tasks early, while others worked closer to deadlines. At first, I felt frustrated because I wanted everyone to work efficiently. However, I soon recognised that imposing my style would cause tension. Over time, we learned to compromise and respect each other’s approaches. For instance, I agreed to wait for input from teammates who needed more time, while they appreciated that I would complete certain tasks in advance.</p>
    <p>Working with a culturally and personally diverse team helped me understand my own biases. Some teammates were more reserved and took time to express ideas, while others were more direct. Initially, I expected everyone to communicate the way I do, but I learned to actively listen and give space for all contributions. This not only improved communication but also led to richer ideas and better solutions.</p>
    <p>I also became more aware of my emotions during this process. I noticed stress and frustration creeping in, particularly when deadlines approached or when tasks were misunderstood. I learned to manage these feelings by focusing on solutions rather than reacting negatively. For example, when a teammate disagreed with my suggestion for the game, instead of arguing, I listened carefully and we worked out a compromise that incorporated both ideas. This approach improved team dynamics and allowed us to work more effectively.</p>
    <p>Through this reflection, I learned that communication is not just about sharing information but also about understanding perspectives, managing emotions, and adapting to different styles. Cultural awareness and emotional regulation played a key role in improving collaboration. Overall, this experience taught me the importance of patience, active listening, and flexibility in achieving successful teamwork.</p>

    <h2>Reflection 3: Training Session – Presentation with Game</h2>
    <p>The “Working in Teams” session was one of the most memorable experiences in this module. Our task was to deliver a presentation and involve the class in an interactive game, which required careful planning and coordination.</p>
    <p>Planning was initially challenging because responsibilities were unclear. As the presentation approached, I felt nervous about whether the game would engage the class and whether our preparation was enough. To manage this stress, I focused on preparation, reviewed the content carefully, and mentally rehearsed how I would explain the game. This helped me feel more confident and prepared to handle unexpected situations.</p>
    <p>During the presentation, a minor issue arose with the game instructions. Some classmates seemed confused about how to participate. I stayed calm, clarified the instructions, and continued the session smoothly. This experience made me realise how important it is to remain composed under pressure and adapt quickly when challenges occur.</p>
    <p>Resilience was essential throughout this process. Coordination issues and differing opinions threatened to delay our preparation, but I continued to contribute actively, attended meetings consistently, and supported teammates. Even when disagreements or delays occurred, I maintained focus and encouraged others to stay engaged. This persistence helped the team overcome obstacles and deliver the presentation successfully.</p>
    <p>Flexibility was equally important. We had to adjust the game rules and presentation flow to fit time constraints. I adapted my approach and encouraged the team to do the same, which improved the overall flow of the session. Working with teammates from different backgrounds taught me to respect diverse perspectives, actively listen, and adjust my behaviour to include different ideas.</p>
    <p>This session strengthened several of my skills. My confidence improved as I realised I could handle stress effectively. Teamwork skills were enhanced through collaboration, compromise, and mutual support. Emotional regulation became crucial, as I learned to manage anxiety while staying focused and contributing meaningfully. Overall, the training session highlighted the importance of resilience, flexibility, and communication in achieving a successful team outcome.</p>

    <h2>Reflection 4: Personal Growth and Team Improvement</h2>
    <p>This team experience had a significant impact on my personal growth. I became more aware of my own cultural biases and started to value different perspectives. Observing how my teammates approached problems differently helped me communicate more effectively and adjust my behaviour to fit the team’s needs.</p>
    <p>I also improved my emotional regulation. I learned to recognise stress, frustration, and anxiety and respond constructively rather than react impulsively. For example, when last-minute changes were needed in the game, instead of panicking, I focused on solutions and supported the team. This helped maintain a positive team environment and ensured the session ran smoothly.</p>
    <p>Persistence and resilience were strengthened through challenges such as time pressure, disagreements, and technical difficulties. I learned that staying engaged and contributing consistently, even under pressure, leads to better outcomes. This experience taught me the value of grit in achieving team goals and overcoming obstacles.</p>
    <p>Flexibility and adaptability were critical in this experience. Adjusting to new roles, incorporating multiple ideas, and responding to changing demands taught me to stay open-minded. For instance, when a teammate suggested a new way to involve the class in the game, I quickly adapted my approach to support the idea. This not only improved the session but also demonstrated the importance of behavioural flexibility in a team setting.</p>
    <p>Overall, this teamwork experience enhanced my confidence, communication, problem-solving, and ability to handle stress and change. I now understand that cultural awareness, emotional regulation, resilience, and adaptability are all essential skills for successful teamwork. These lessons will be invaluable in my future entrepreneurship projects, as working effectively in diverse teams is a key part of building and managing a business.</p>
